# HTML Tables CW

### Exercise 1:
Create the table in ```Example1.png```. PUSH ONCE COMPLETE.

### Example 2
Create a table for 3 YouTube videos. Create 4 columns: the YouTube video, channel name, video name (with a link to the video), and the date it was uploaded. Hint: ```<a>```

### BONUS:
For both tables, use CSS to collapse borders, add striping for every other row, and any other style improvements you can think of. Experiment!
