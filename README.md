# HTML Tables CW
Use CSS for all styling!

### Exercise 1:
Reproduce the table in ```Example1.png```. 

### Example 2
Create a table for 3 (or more) of your favorite YouTube videos. Create 4 columns: the embedded YouTube video, channel name, video name (with a link to the video), and the date it was uploaded. 

### BONUS:
For both tables, use CSS to collapse borders, add striping for every other row, and any other style improvements you can think of. Experiment!
